                        <li><h3>World Coffee History</h3></li>
                        <p>Coffee was first known by the Galla tribe in East Africa around 1000 BC. By the 5th century AD, coffee was known throughout Ethiopia. Around 700-1000 AD, the Arabs first recognized coffee as an energy drink. The first source of coffee was in Mocha, a region in Yemen. In the early 11th century, Ibn Sina investigated the chemical properties of coffee, documenting its medicinal and health benefits.</p>
                        <p>The spread of coffee and coffee houses rapidly expanded in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Mecca and Medina around 1400. Coffee was introduced to Constantinople by the Turks (Ottoman Empire) in 1453. The first recorded coffee house, Kiva Han, opened in 1475.</p>
                        <p>In 1600, Pope Clement VIII considered "coffee culture" as heresy and an infidel threat. However, he eventually allowed coffee to be consumed as a permissible food or drink for Christians. That same year, coffee was brought from Mecca to India by Baba Budan. In 1616, coffee was brought from Mocha to the Netherlands. The first coffee house in Venice, Italy opened in 1645.</p>
                        <p>The first coffee house in a Christian country, specifically in Oxford, England, opened in 1650. In 1658, the Dutch established their first coffee plantation in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). By 1668, Edward Lloyd's coffee house opened in London, which later became Lloyd's of London Insurance.</p>
                        <p>Coffee began to be known in North America in 1668. In 1669, a Turkish ambassador introduced coffee houses in Paris to King Louis XIV. By 1670, coffee became popular in London, with coffee houses opening on every corner. Coffee was also introduced in Germany, and coffee cultivation began in Brazil. In 1674, the Women's Petition Against Coffee was published in London. In 1675, tea houses began to be introduced in the Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>In 1675, King Charles II closed all coffee houses in London, accusing them of being centers of conspiracy. In 1679, a chemist in Marseilles, France, testified that coffee was harmful to health. The first coffee house in Hamburg, Germany, opened in 1679. By 1688, over 800 coffee houses had opened in Soho, mainly by French Huguenot refugees. In 1689, the first French-style café, Café de Procope, opened despite the ongoing health controversies.</p>
                        <p>In 1696, the first coffee house, The King's Arms, opened in New York. A Dutch citizen named Zwaardecroon (later a Dutch Governor-General) brought coffee seeds from Mocha to Bogor, Indonesia. Over time, these seeds became the most important commodity crop in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch established a region in West Java exclusively for coffee cultivation called Preanger Stelsel. In 1706, Java coffee was researched in Amsterdam. The research results were introduced and planted in the Jardin des Plantes by King Louis XIV in 1714. The Florian coffee house opened in Florence in 1720. Gabriel du Clieu brought coffee seeds from France to Martinique in 1723. In 1727, Francisco de Mello brought coffee seeds from France to Brazil for cultivation.</p>
                        <p>In 1730, the English began cultivating coffee in Jamaica. In 1732, Johann Sebastian Bach composed the Coffee Cantata in Leipzig, a parody of German fears about the rising popularity of coffee. In 1777, the King of Prussia criticized and banned coffee, declaring beer the national drink of Greater Germany. By 1790, early English-style coffee houses began to disappear, replaced by taverns.</p>
                        <p>In 1802, the term café was introduced in England (previously coffee house). The word café originates from the French word "café" and is closely related to the Italian "caffe." A café refers to a place that serves coffee as its main menu item.</p>
                        <p>The first coffee imports from Brazil entered the US market in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1809. In 1820, the caffeine content in coffee was discovered by three different researchers: Runge, Robiquet, and Pelletier and Caventou. In 1822, the prototype of an espresso machine was made in France. In 1839, the word "cafeteria" was introduced as a hybrid term from Mexico, Spain, and England. In 1859, Michael Thonet's Vienna Café chair No. 14 was introduced as the "perfect chair for sipping coffee."</p>
                        <p>In 1869, coffee leaf rust was first discovered in Ceylon and coffee plants in Asia. In 1873, John Arbuckle introduced mass-packaged coffee in the United States. In 1882, The New York Coffee Exchange was established.</p>
                        <p>In 1869, a disease caused by a fungus spread throughout Asia, damaging coffee plants, particularly Coffea arabica. People began planting various types of coffee found in the Congo region. By the 20th century, coffee had become a significant commodity globally.</p>
                        <h5>Coffee in the 20th Century</h5>
                        <p>In 1904, the espresso machine was modernized by Fernando Illy. In 1906, Brazil increased coffee prices after creating a fixed price for the commodity. In 1910, Germany introduced decaf coffee (reducing caffeine in coffee to a minimum) and introduced it to the United States under the name dekafa. In 1911, coffee merchants in the United States formed the National Coffee Association.</p>
                        <p>In 1915, Pyrex was discovered. Initially used as a heat-resistant and durable lamp cover in railroad companies, Pyrex was introduced as kitchenware, replacing glass. Coffee houses used Pyrex as heat-resistant glasses.</p>
                        <p>In 1920, coffee houses became popular in the United States. In 1925, Vienna Café chair No. 14 was exhibited at L’esprit Nouveau in France by Le Corbusier. By 1933, this chair model had been produced over 50 million times. In 1927, the first espresso machine was introduced in the United States. The first coffee house to use it was La Pavoni in New York, designed by renowned Italian architect Gio Ponti. In 1928, the Colombian Coffee Federation was formed.</p>
                        <p>From 1930-1944, Brazil destroyed 78 million bags of coffee to stabilize prices. In 1938, Cremonesi developed a piston pump that could spray hot water at high speed to brew coffee. In 1938, Nestle invented instant coffee in Brazil. Today, Nestle is the world's largest producer of instant coffee. During World War II (1939-1945), US troops introduced instant coffee globally.</p>
                        <p>In 1942, coffee became a secretly hoarded commodity. In England, coffee was rationed to a certain amount. In 1946, the Gaggia factory produced the first commercial cappuccino machines. The word cappuccino comes from the color of the Capuchin monk's robes (a Franciscan order in 1529). In 1948, Achille Gaggia mass-produced espresso machines in Milan.</p>
                        <p>In 1952, Gaggia machines were imported to England. That year, post-World War II coffee houses opened in London in July. In 1953, espresso bars spread throughout Soho, with the first espresso bar being Mocha at 29 Frith Street. However, in 1954, coffee ownership restrictions ended with the end of the post-World War II transition period.</p>
                        <p>In 1957, Catherine Uttley recorded 200 coffee bars in London. Many coffee bars began using plastic for kitchenware, dining utensils, flooring, and furniture. By 1960, the number of coffee bars had doubled from 1,000 to 2,000. Coffee bars became popular for their unique music offerings, the most famous being the 2i’s Coffee Bar in London, where Cliff Richard and Tommy Steele began their careers.</p>
                        <p>In 1963, Dr. Ernest Illy introduced pre-packaged and pre-ground coffee, known as ESE coffee pods. In 1971, the first Starbucks opened in Seattle, Washington, by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker. In 1974, the Illy factory in Trieste, Italy, created the Illy logo.</p>
                        <p>In 1987, Alfred Peet was inspired by his family to create a high-quality coffee shop. Alfred Peet is credited with popularizing coffee consumption and coffee culture in the United States. In 1989, Sean Combs, a rapper and producer, introduced coffee-based cocktails at a club in New York. In 1992, the Starbucks company began using the iconic green aprons. In 1995, Starbucks entered the Indonesian market by opening its first store in Plaza Indonesia. In 1999, Starbucks changed its logo to a more modern design.</p>

                        <li><h3>Indonesian Coffee History</h3></li>
                        <p>The history of coffee in Indonesia began in the late 17th century when the Dutch brought coffee plants to the archipelago. The plants were first introduced in the Batavia region (now Jakarta). The Dutch East India Company (VOC) played a significant role in establishing coffee plantations in Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Bali.</p>
                        <p>By the early 18th century, coffee from Java became one of the most sought-after commodities in Europe. The Dutch established a coffee trading monopoly and used forced labor systems to maximize production. The term "Java" became synonymous with coffee.</p>
                        <p>During the 19th century, the coffee industry in Indonesia faced challenges due to plant diseases and changing economic conditions. The arrival of coffee rust disease in the 1860s led to the decline of Coffea arabica cultivation. To counter this, the Dutch introduced Coffea liberica and Coffea robusta varieties, which were more resistant to diseases.</p>
                        <p>In the 20th century, Indonesia's coffee industry underwent significant changes. During the Japanese occupation (1942-1945), coffee production was disrupted. After gaining independence in 1945, Indonesia restructured its coffee industry, focusing on smallholder farmers rather than large plantations.</p>
                        <p>Today, Indonesia is one of the world's largest coffee producers, known for its diverse and unique coffee varieties. Regions such as Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and Bali are renowned for their distinct coffee profiles, influenced by the local climate and processing methods.</p>

                    <article id="World Barista History" class="card">
                        <li><h3>World Barista History</h3></li>
                        <p>The role of the barista has evolved significantly over the centuries. The term "barista" originates from Italy, where it simply means "bartender." However, the modern concept of a barista, as we know it today, developed with the rise of coffee culture and espresso machines.</p>
                        <p>The first espresso machine was invented in the early 20th century by Luigi Bezzera. These early machines were steam-powered and required a skilled operator to control the brewing process. The introduction of the lever-operated espresso machine by Achille Gaggia in 1947 marked a significant advancement, allowing baristas to have greater control over the pressure and extraction time.</p>
                        <p>In the mid-20th century, espresso culture spread from Italy to other parts of Europe and North America. The role of the barista became more specialized, with an emphasis on the art and science of coffee preparation. Baristas were trained to master the nuances of espresso extraction, milk frothing, and latte art.</p>
                        <p>In the 21st century, the barista profession has gained recognition and respect as a skilled craft. The specialty coffee movement has elevated the role of the barista, with a focus on sourcing high-quality beans, precise brewing techniques, and customer education. Competitions such as the World Barista Championship (WBC), established in 2000, have further highlighted the expertise and creativity of baristas worldwide.</p>

                        <li><h3>Indonesian Barista History</h3></li>
                        <p>The history of baristas in Indonesia is intertwined with the country's rich coffee culture. In the early days, coffee was primarily prepared using traditional methods, such as kopi tubruk, a simple brewing technique involving boiling water and coffee grounds.</p>
                        <p>With the introduction of espresso machines in the late 20th century, the role of the barista began to emerge. Coffee shops in urban areas started to adopt modern brewing equipment, and baristas were trained to operate these machines. The growing popularity of coffee shops, influenced by global coffee trends, led to an increased demand for skilled baristas.</p>
                        <p>In the 21st century, Indonesia has seen a rapid growth in specialty coffee shops and a burgeoning barista community. Indonesian baristas have gained international recognition for their skills and creativity. Competitions such as the Indonesia Barista Championship (IBC) have provided a platform for baristas to showcase their talents and learn from global industry leaders.</p>
                        <p>Today, Indonesian baristas continue to innovate and contribute to the global coffee culture. They play a crucial role in promoting Indonesian coffee varieties and educating consumers about the rich heritage and diverse flavors of Indonesian coffee.</p>
